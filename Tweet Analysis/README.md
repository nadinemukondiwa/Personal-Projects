# Analyzing tweets about Korean Dramas
A few years ago, I started watching Korean dramas. While I have never posted on social media about watching them, I analyzed different tweets about Korean drama. I used the [Twitter Search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/overview) to get tweets with the hashtag "#kdrama" and "#netflix" or "#koreandrama" and "netflix." 

### What dramas that aired in 2020 had tweets with their hashtags?

Most hashtags used were for the drama 'Love Struck in the City.' February 1st 'Love Struck in the City' was still on Netflix as a weekly show. 

'Run On' had the third-highest number of hashtags used. 'Run On' had its last episode during the week the data was extracted, which may be why its hashtag was used in more tweets. 

'Sweet Home' was released on December 18th, 2020 as a whole series, which may be why it has more hashtags than 'Itaewon Class,' 'The King Eternal March,' 'Start-Up,' 'Hospital Playlist,' It's Okay to Not Be Okay' which all aired earlier in 2020. 

Surprisingly, 'The Uncanny Encounter' had its last episode on January 24th, 2021, but has fewer hashtags. The lower number of hashtags for 'The Uncanny Encounter' may mean the drama was less popular. However, the data frame only consists of 500 tweets.



### Which dramas were mentioned in the tweets, and how many times?
